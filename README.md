## prerequisits (with time and effort estimation)
1. Partial Derivatives (I think we covered it quite well )
2. Matrices (Same as above)
3. Python Fundamentals:
	1. [mit60001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/ "mit60001")
	This course is 12 lectures explaining python fundamentals , oop , etc 
	Estimated effort for revision (I.E familiar with pyhton 2-3 days each of 2 hours)
	Estimated effort for someone familear with programming in general (7-days 2 hours each)
	For totally beginners i think each lecture may take one day 1-2 hours of dedicated studying 
	[Think Python](http://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Allen+B.+Downey&column=author "Think Python")
	go through this book parallel to the course above
	1. shortcuts : if you are short of time you may skip the above and go from here 
		- [Datacamp python fundamentals skill track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/python-fundamentals?version=1 "Datacamp python fundamentals skill track")
		DataCamp is not the best for understaning however I think it has a good practical side which makes things much faster but I think it is crucial to have deep understanding of the topics.
	1. [OOP ELZERO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7WP_402HE0&list=PLUgz8T_NoattU54gGARPXPmmawQNl-1_T "OOP ELZERO")
	1. [w3hschools](https://www.w3schools.com/ "w3hschools")
	1. [DataCamp OOP ](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-python/inheritance-and-polymorphism?ex=1 "DataCamp OOP ")
		For anyone who wants to get his hands into python I recommend this course 
	Remember that searching is always needed you will never find a complete resource or the state of art road map 
	
	**Lets structure it a bit more to help you decide which way to go:**
	First categotrtize yourself (Remember that the only person you should not fool is yourself)
	**IF Iam a beginner in programming then go for MIT60001 and ThinkPython study them really carefully then apply on datacamp**<br>
	**I know programming but not in python go for w3hschools to get familier with python syntax then go for MIT60001 lecture 8, 9 only**<br>
	**Already a pythonista just go for OOP FROM elzero as a fast revision and you are good to go**<br>

We have covered the fundamentals mentioned by Dr Mina however I think we need to get familiar with some libraries in python as Numpy and Pandas 
so keep this repository for statistics and datascience resources **Note : always check my github repos for further updates**
